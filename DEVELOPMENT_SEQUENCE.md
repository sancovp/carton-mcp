# HEAVEN Development Sequence

## The Complete Development Roadmap

As outlined by the founder:

> "Maybe the sequence could be: Idea system, kanban system (sibling MCPs for sqlite, github), then the repo system (ecosystems, the automations that I personally need/maybe look into packages people already made for this), then the rest of the HEAVEN acolyte, disciple, master system. Then, tree repl (unless jeremy wants to see react app then heaven_chat) with the prompt engineering agent that self-learns, then the coder that self-learns but has project level and global level learning), then the researcher"

## Phase 1: Foundation Systems

### 1. Idea System
- **Current**: Idea Concepts MCP (this project)
- **Purpose**: Zettelkasten + Neo4j + GitHub integration
- **Goal**: Capture, link, and visualize ideas with AI collaboration
- **Status**: In development

### 2. Kanban System (Sibling MCPs)
- **SQLite MCP**: Local task management with tree priorities
- **GitHub MCP**: Public issue tracking and collaboration
- **Integration**: Cross-reference system linking local tasks to GitHub issues
- **Purpose**: "What we show" vs "how we work" separation

### 3. Repo System (Ecosystems)
- **Ecosystem Management**: Multi-repo coordination and automation
- **Personal Automations**: Workflows the founder specifically needs
- **Package Integration**: Research existing solutions before building custom
- **Goal**: Streamlined repository management and deployment

## Phase 2: HEAVEN Learning Hierarchy

### 4. HEAVEN Acolyte, Disciple, Master System
- **Acolyte**: Basic AI agent functionality
- **Disciple**: Enhanced learning and context management
- **Master**: Advanced reasoning and autonomous operation
- **Purpose**: Graduated AI capability levels

## Phase 3: Interactive Development Environment

### 5. Tree REPL vs Heaven Chat
- **Decision Point**: "unless jeremy wants to see react app then heaven_chat"
- **Tree REPL**: Command-line interface for direct AI interaction
- **Heaven Chat**: Web-based interface for broader appeal
- **Includes**: Self-learning prompt engineering agent

### 6. The Self-Learning Coder
- **Project Level Learning**: Understands current project context
- **Global Level Learning**: Accumulates knowledge across projects
- **Continuous Improvement**: Adapts coding patterns based on experience
- **Integration**: Works with the idea system and kanban for context

### 7. The Researcher
- **Final Component**: Advanced research and discovery capabilities
- **Purpose**: Autonomous investigation and knowledge synthesis
- **Integration**: Feeds discoveries back into the idea system

## Architecture Philosophy

This sequence follows a **foundation-first approach**:

1. **Thinking Layer** (Ideas) → **Planning Layer** (Kanban) → **Execution Layer** (Repos)
2. **Basic AI** (Acolyte) → **Enhanced AI** (Disciple) → **Advanced AI** (Master)  
3. **Interface** (REPL/Chat) → **Autonomous Coder** → **Autonomous Researcher**

Each phase builds on the previous, creating a complete AI development ecosystem where:
- Ideas flow naturally into tasks
- Tasks connect to actual development work
- AI agents learn and improve continuously
- The entire system becomes increasingly autonomous

## Strategic Considerations

### Decision Points
- **Tree REPL vs React App**: Depends on target audience (developers vs broader users)
- **Custom vs Existing Packages**: Research existing solutions before building
- **Learning Integration**: How each component feeds back into the learning system

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1**: Can capture, organize, and act on ideas effectively
- **Phase 2**: AI agents demonstrate measurable learning and improvement
- **Phase 3**: System becomes genuinely autonomous for routine development tasks

## The End Goal

A complete AI-powered development environment where:
- **Ideas** are captured and connected automatically
- **Tasks** flow from ideas with proper tracking
- **Code** is written by AI agents that learn from each project
- **Research** happens autonomously to feed new ideas
- **The human** focuses on vision and high-level direction

This sequence transforms the current ad-hoc "dev in chat" approach into a systematic, learning-enabled development platform that maintains the spontaneity while adding structure and automation.
